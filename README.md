## Scripts

These are just a handful of scripts I happen to use sometimes

* [backup](./backup) - backup home to an external drive using rsync
* [bwbb](./bwbb) - a bitwarden-cli wrapper
* [quotes](./quotes) - Solution for storing and outputing quotes
* [power_now](power_now) - Print current power draw of the system
* [video to gif](./video_to_gif) - Render a gif from an input video
* [typeracer history](./typeracer_history_crawler) - Crawl typeracer history for a user
