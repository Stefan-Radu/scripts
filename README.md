## Scripts

These are just a handful of scripts I happen to use sometimes

* [backup](./backup) - backup home to an external drive using rsync
* [bbw](./bbw) - a bitwarden-cli wrapper
* [quotes](./quotes) - Solution for storing and outputing quotes
* [video to gif](./video_to_gif) - Render a gif from an input video
